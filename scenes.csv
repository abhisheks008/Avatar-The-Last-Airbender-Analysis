He finds the traps' mechanisms, undoes them, and carefully lowers Momo to the ground where Katara and Sokka are waiting. They open the trap together and the lemur runs out with one of the lychee nuts in his mouth. Katara and Sokka look on as Momo gets on his hind legs and eats it as though nothing has happened.

"3238",5465,"[She has not moved, although her hand is on her head as she sits on the root they have fallen onto.]"
"3239",5466,"[He looks away before airbending himself to his feet. He appears embarrassed that he was not actively searching for his friends like they were him.]"

"3249",5493,"[He finally puts his machete away.]"
"3250",5494,"[He sits on the tree, looking at the group as he explains.]"
"3251",5495,"[Humoring Huu.]"
"3252",5496,"[The camera zooms out as he explains, slowly revealing more and more of the swamp. It shows how large the banyan-grove tree is compared to the others, but at the final magnification, it is impossible to distinguish it from the other trees.]"
"3253",5497,"[Cuts back to Aang, looking at Huu. He is still openly skeptical.]"
"3254",5498,"[Another shot shows the swamp river. There are the sounds of several animals heard in the background.]"
"3255",5499,"[She and her friends are now sitting, listening to Huu.]"
"3256",5500,"[The shot cuts to show the people that Sokka and Katara saw in the swamp, before cutting back to Huu.]"

"3258",5506,"[Aang kneels down and places his hand on the tree.]"
"3259",5506,"[Energy travels from Aang's hand to Appa's location. Appa is seen being captured by the Foggy Swamp members. Back at the banyan-grove tree, Aang stands up.]"
"3260",5508,"[Singing and tapping the side of his canoe. Momo is seen struggling inside the sack he has been placed in.]"
"3261",5515,"[Due ceases waterbending, followed by a slightly disgusted Katara. He watches as Sokka and Huu run up to the branch Katara and Aang are standing on.]"
"3262",5520,"[He indicates the catgator lying behind Tho.]"
"3263",5525,"[Laughing.]"
"3264",5527,"[Smiling. Sokka is shown chewing nonchalantly next to her.]"
"3265",5531,"[To Katara.]"
"3266",5531,"[He raises his arms for emphasis.]"
"3267",5535,"[Feeding Momo.]"

"3269",5544,"[Angrily.]"
"3270",5544,"[Momo chitters happily while lying upside down on Sokka's belly, chewing on the fly he ""rescued"" from the spider's web.]"
"3271",5546,"[Shouting from up above as he looks over the campsite.]"

"3281",5560,"[Bowing his head in defeat by this totally honest answer.]"
"3282",5562,"[To a sulking Sokka.]"
"3283",5564,"[Sadly.]"
"3284",5564,"[He jumps up and moves Aang's hat slightly so that he can point at Aang's arrow.]"
"3285",5564,"[Makes a hair loopies gesture with a somewhat bored look.]"
"3286",5567,"[He picks up the basket full of supplies, looking dejected at the nickname.]"
"3287",5569,"[Surprised, after inspecting the money.]"
"3288",5571,"[Clutching the coin.]"
"3289",5571,"[The merchant closes his shop, while Katara walks over to Aang, who is trying to console a crying Sokka as the camera pans up to show just the merchant's head.]"
"3290",5572,"[Interested.]"
"3291",5573,"[Turning around while waving.]"
"3292",5577,"[Pointing at the float.]"

"3297",5588,"[Surprised.]"
"3298",5590,"[Chanting as Kyoshi's effigy is consumed by the flames.]"
"3299",5592,"[Wondering.]"
"3300",5593,"[Angrily, while walking away.]"
"3301",5594,"[Seriously.]"
"3302",5594,"[Takes a bite out of one of the cupcakes Zuko brought. The jam drips of his chin. In delight.]"
"3303",5596,"[Angrily pointing an accusing finger at Katara.]"
"3304",5598,"[Angered.]"
"3305",5598,"[He takes off his hat and throws it away to reveal his arrow.]"
"3306",5599,"[Pointing in shock at Aang.]"
"3307",5600,"[Scared.]"
"3308",5603,"[Crawling back on his feet.]"
"3309",5603,"[He waves them away with a gesture of his hand.]"
"3310",5606,"[Landing beside Katara.]"
"3311",5608,"[Calmly.]"
"3312",5608,"[Raising his voice.]"
"3313",5609,"[Utterly shocked.]"
"3314",5610,"[Lisping and slurring.]"
"3315",5610,"[Pointing at himself as the camera zooms in on him.]"

"3320",5618,"[Confidently.]"
"3321",5622,"[Apologetically.]"
"3322",5626,"[Upbeat.]"
"3323",5626,"[Theatrically jumps back and pretends to airbend by blowing air. Katara looks ashamed for her brother. He moves to the back of the room to ""cut"" the air.]"
"3324",5626,"[He makes a grotesque movement with his arm before thrusting his face in the camera.]"
"3325",5626,"[He resumes his place beside Katara, who is still looking annoyed by her brother. He makes a circular motion with his hands and points toward the door.]"
"3326",5628,"[Slightly mocking.]"
"3327",5628,"[Serious tone as she looks at Aang.]"
"3328",5629,"[Unhappy.]"

"3334",5634,"[Aang is making fun of Sokka, Katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs.]"
"3335",5636,"[Pretends to ponder about the question. Katara stares at him, trying to figure out what he is doing.]"
"3336",5636,"[The camera spins around. When it stops again, Sokka is wearing a hat with a monocle.]"
"3337",5636,"[Katara looks surprised at his new outfit and giggles. Sokka extends his monocle to investigate her.]"
"3338",5638,"[Cut to Sokka, who inquisitively looks around. He gazes directly into the camera lens through his magnifying glass, making his left eye appear huge. He moves on to investigate the walls of the shrine, while the mayor is standing at the edge of the cliff, pointing down at something.]"
"3339",5638,"[Sokka quickly squats beside the footprint to take a closer look at it.]"
"3340",5638,"[They all look up at a statue of Chin the Great, who has a raised left hand in triumph.]"

"7587",13321,"[Aang, under control of his past lives, combines all four elements together for his final attack. At the last second, however, he manages to regain control; he comes out of the Avatar State, lets his attack die out, and floats to the ground, freeing Ozai in the process.]"
"7588",13326,"[Aang remembering.]"
"7589",13328,"[Out of breath.]"
"7590",13331,"[Pretends to be Aang fighting Ozai while adding sound effects.]"
"7591",13331,"[Pretends to be Ozai struggling and groaning.]"
"7592",13332,"[Pointing to the exhausted Ozai while approaching him.]"
"7593",13333,"[Defiantly and slowly.]"

"7595",13335,"[Surprised.]"
"7596",13337,"[Smiling.]"
"7597",13339,"[Weakly.]"
"7598",13339,"[Flops on the ground while semi-conscious and drooling.]"
"7599",13340,"[Mockingly.]"
"7600",13341,"[Patheically.]"
"7601",13342,"[Pointing at Suki before pointing to herself; gently.]"
"7602",13348,"[Blushes.]"
"7603",13348,"[They kiss. When they break apart, Mai's tone and expression changes to a serious and stern one.]"
"7604",13348,"[Zuko grins nervously, before they hug again.]"
"7605",13350,"[They run to Hakoda and embrace him.]"
"7606",13351,"[Turns to Katara.]"
"7607",13351,"[Katara sheds a few tears of joy while touching her necklace.]"
"7608",13354,"[Appearing from behind.]"
"7609",13355,"[Protects Suki and points his crutch at Ty Lee.]"
"7610",13356,"[Sokka turns to Ty Lee before turning back to Suki, with a stunned look for both.]"
"7611",13357,"[She hugs two other warriors and they all smile.]"
"7612",13363,"[Puts a hand on Aang's shoulder.]"
"7613",13363,"[They hug warmly and go outside.]"
"7614",13365,"[Aang walks next to Zuko. Crowd cheers again. Aang turns his head slightly. Cut to side-view of Katara. The camera rotates as she smiles up at Aang proudly. Cut to overhead view of Aang and Zuko, their backs to the camera, looking out at the crowd.]"
"7615",13365,"[Cut briefly to Haru, Tyro, Mechanist and Teo as the crowd cheers. Cut to front view of Zuko.]"
"7616",13365,"[Panning front view of Zuko and Aang, as seen from the crowd's perspective.]"
"7617",13365,"[Cut to side shot of Aang, rotating around, as he turns to see Zuko smile at him, before turning back to the crowd.]"
"7618",13367,"[Puts the Fire Lord headpiece into Zuko's top knot.]"
"7619",13367,"[Everyone cheers again. Zuko rises.]"
"7620",13369,"[Sarcastically.]"
"7621",13374,"[Bends closer to Ozai; gravely.]"
"7622",13377,"[Suddenly looks annoyed. Cuts to Sokka's painting, which is very unlike the group.]"
"7623",13382,"[Momo jumps on to the table and chitters.]"
"7624",13382,"[Momo chitters again as Aang goes outside.]"
"7625",13383,"[Points at painting.]"
"7626",13384,"[They laugh.]"
